Conclusion:

I have tried to complete this project as accurate as possible. All the contents are based on the reference webpage along with the links and pictures. I have tried to challenge myself in accomplising this webpage.

Future Prospects:
I am willing to develop a few aspects of the project and work on the hovering effects and highlights in future. I am open to suggestions as well thus any contribution to this project is welcome.
